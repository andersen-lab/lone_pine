# SEARCH Alliance's sequencing dashboard
This repository contains the code for maintaining and publishing a dashboard for the sequencing efforts of the 
Andersen lab @ Scripps Research. Currently, only San Diego and Baja California focused dashboards are generated. 
You can access the San Diego dashboard [here](http://sd-sequencing.info/) or on the 
[SEARCH website](https://searchcovid.info/sequencing-statistics/). The Baja California dashboard can similarly be 
accessed [here](http://sd-sequencing.info/bajacalifornia) and [here](https://searchcovid.info/baja-california-dashboard/).
Raw sequencing data and lineage calls for these and other locations can be found in our 
[Genomics repository](https://github.com/andersen-lab/HCoV-19-Genomics).


**Disclaimer**. Please note that this data is still based on work in progress and should be considered preliminary. If 
you intend to include any of these data in publications, please let us know – otherwise please feel free to download and
use without restrictions. We have shared this data with the hope that people will download and use it, as well as 
scrutinize it, so we can improve our methods and analyses. Please contact us if you have any questions or comments – 
we’ll buy beers for #ResearchParasites that spot flaws and faults in the data and come up with improvements!
